    summary: 'Spot and contract rates on the main lanes, and the capacity carriers deploy against them.',
    definition:
      'What it costs to move a container on the major east–west and north–south lanes, and the supply side that sets that price: vessel orderbooks, blank sailings, alliance reshuffles, idle tonnage and scrapping.',
    whyItMatters: {
      toInvestors:
        'Freight is one of the few prices that responds to a physical disruption within days rather than quarters. A sustained move is an early read on inventory decisions that retailers and manufacturers will not describe for another reporting cycle, and it lands in gross margin on a predictable lag.',
      toOperators:
        'It is a direct line item and a planning input. The gap between the spot market and contract rates is what decides whether to lock in a rate now or ride the index, and that decision is usually made months before the cost appears.',
    },
    whatIsReported:
      'Which lane moved, by how much relative to its own recent range, and whether capacity or demand is doing the work — the two have different half-lives. Where a comparable episode has happened before, what followed it.',

    title: 'Chokepoints and canal transits',
    summary: 'Suez, Panama, Bab el-Mandeb, Hormuz, Malacca — and the conditions that throttle them.',
    definition:
      'The narrow passages a large share of seaborne trade has to cross, and everything that changes how much gets through them: draught and slot restrictions, drought, security conditions, war-risk insurance, and the transit-booking rules canal authorities set.',
    whyItMatters: {
      toInvestors:
        'A throttled chokepoint does not only delay cargo, it absorbs vessel capacity. A longer voyage ties up the same ship for more days, which tightens effective supply across the whole market rather than one route. The sequence is usually freight and war-risk premiums first, delivery times second, and input costs for whoever sits at the end of that lane third.',
      toOperators:
        'A rerouting adds weeks to transit time, which changes safety stock, working capital and every promise made to a customer downstream of it. The routing decision often has to be made before the disruption is confirmed.',

    summary: 'Throughput and dwell time at major ports, and the rail and road that clear them.',
    definition:
      'How much cargo is moving across the major container and bulk terminals, how long it sits once landed, and the condition of the rail, barge and trucking capacity that has to take it inland. Congestion is rarely only at the quayside.',
    whyItMatters: {
      toInvestors:
        'Dwell time is a cleaner read than volume on whether goods are genuinely moving. Sustained congestion at a gateway port pulls forward ordering, distorts the next quarter of import data, and tends to show up as an inventory swing that gets misread as demand.',
      toOperators:
        'Dwell time is schedule risk, and the inland leg is where it usually compounds. A terminal clearing normally with no chassis or rail capacity behind it is still a delay.',

    whyItMatters: {
      toInvestors:
        'The announcement is not the event. Scope, effective date and the substitution available to the affected buyer decide whether a measure is a cost pass-through, a margin hit or noise. Most of that is in the text of the measure and almost none of it is in the headline.',
      toOperators:
        'Classification and rules of origin set the landed cost line by line. An exclusion process, a tariff engineering option or a change of origin can be worth more than any hedge, and all of them run on published deadlines.',

    whyItMatters: {
      toInvestors:
        'Concentration is the risk, and it usually sits a step further upstream than expected: refining rather than mining, a single grade rather than a metal. One export-licensing decision can reprice a downstream sector that looked diversified.',

    whyItMatters: {
      toInvestors:
        'Fuel is the largest variable cost in shipping, so it sets a floor under freight rates. It also sets vessel speed: when fuel is expensive ships slow down, which removes effective capacity from the market without a single vessel leaving it.',
